  /** 
   * This class is an implementation of a smart pointer.  IT IS NOT
   * THREAD SAFE.  This means that you cannot use SmartPointers
   * to the same data in different threads.  Even if you make a new
   * copy of the smart pointer.  This is because they will still share
   * the same Counter.  However, SmartPointer
   * is faster because it is not thread safe.
   *
   * You can use a SmartPointer on a dynamic instance of a class A as 
   * follows.
   *
   * SmartPointer<A> aPtr = new A;
   *
   * Since aPtr is static when it goes out of scope it will be destructed.
   * When this happens the reference counter will be decremented and if
   * it is zero the dynamic instance of A will be destructed.
   *
   * You can make a copy of a smart pointer as follows.
   *
   * SmartPointer<A> anotherPtr = aPtr;
   *
   * Now the dynamic instance of A will not be destructed until both
   * aPtr and anotherPtr go out of scope.
   *
   * Correct deallocation can vary depending on the type of resource being
   * protected by the smart pointer.  The DEALLOC_T template parameter selects
   * the deallocator.  The default deallocator is used for any data allocated
   * with the 'new' operator.  SP_ARRAY is necessary for arrays allocated with
   * the 'new []' operator.  SP_MALLOC will correctly deallocate data allocated
   * with calls to 'malloc', 'calloc', 'realloc', et.al.
   *
   * You can also create your own deallocators for other resources.  The
   * managed resources need not even be memory.
   *
   * See http://ootips.org/yonat/4dev/smart-pointers.html for more information
   * about smart pointers and why to use them.
